                <p id="main-about-hi">Hi, I'm Ramakanth. </p> <br>

                <p> I am a 22-year-old who enjoys everything that lies at the crux of technology and management. While
                    pursuing a major in Computer Science from Hyderabad In the Sreenidhi institute of scienc and Technology. </p>
                <br>
                <p> During my life as a student, I have developed several technical and managerial skills. While leading
                    several clubs and organizations, I picked up the following: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> A knack for leadership </li>
                    <li> A dream to do something different </li>
                    <li>The desire to impact as many young minds as possible. </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p> I'm a technology buff and you can always find me talking about:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li> Full-Stack Development </li>
                    <li>AI and Robotics </li>
                    <li> Data and Business Analytics </li>
                    <li>Cryptocurrency and Blockchain </li>
                    <li>Stock Trading </li>
                    <li>Automobiles </li>
                    <li>and much more. </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p> On a slightly lighter note, I love traveling to unexplored natural marvels, striking intellectually
                    stimulating conversations, and stalking cricketers. </p> <br>

                <p> When I'm not freaking out about work, you can find me gorging on the delicious Hyderabadi Biryani.
                </p> <br>
